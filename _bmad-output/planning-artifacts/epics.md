**Given** the tui/screens/debug.py module
**When** Debug screen is displayed
**Then** StateInspector shows TUIState fields
**And** raw events tab shows unprocessed events
**And** config tab shows current configuration
**And** state can be refreshed manually

### Story 10.6: TUI CLI Integration

As a developer,
I want CLI commands for launching TUI,
So that I can monitor executions from the command line.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the cli/commands/tui.py module
**When** I run `ouroboros tui monitor`
**Then** TUI application launches
**And** `--execution-id` monitors specific execution
**And** `--session-id` monitors specific session
**And** keyboard navigation works (1-5 for screens, q to quit)

Each Epic provides **complete, standalone functionality** while building upon previous Epics. No Epic requires a future Epic to function.
